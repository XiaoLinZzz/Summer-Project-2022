# Summer Project - 2022

This respority is to show my summer project of 2022. 
Our idea is to combine the SLIC algorithm with the Vision Transformer to improve the performance of the Vision Transformer. 

Here is the rough schematic diagram in [miro](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/RmhDZGhsYnZZVGhNVzB5cGJwYXZxN2k4cVc1RWJ6Z3lPTXU0ZlBhTmtDSGJUNnpVa0lORk9jMGdqZWFRZnMxZXwzNDU4NzY0NTMyMDI2OTgyMTY2fDI=?share_link_id=744521960709).


## Demo
We create a [demo](demo.ipynb) to show how SLIC algorithm works and how to use our work.

## Dataset
More details about dataset can be found in the [README-dataset](README-dataset.md) file.

## Some points that remain unmet
- Combine the SLIC algorithm with the Vision Transformer
- SLIC (skimage vision) does not support the GPU
