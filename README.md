# Summer Project Research - 2022

This is a simple application of the SLIC algorithm for superpixel generation. The SLIC algorithm is described in the paper [SLIC Superpixels](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/research/slic-superpixels/).

## Demo
We create a [demo](demo.ipynb) to show how SLIC algorithm works and how to use our work.

## Dataset
More details about dataset can be found in the [README-dataset](README-dataset.md) file.
